This project is a tier list website created using React. This website allows users to put the images into different containers to rank them against each other. The images are on the webpage through an API so that additional lists of images can be created in the future. Each row's label/name & colour can be changed to make it clearer what the images are being ranked by. New rows and columns can be added to the tier list.
